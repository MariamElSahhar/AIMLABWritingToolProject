November 15th

- Updated comments, please read
- Modify the Angle_config so that the motors know their own position
- Allow the motors to move together
... i just realized that literally means doing inverse kinematics



November 12nd

- Read/ understand inverse kinematics
- Write a function that takes two values (x-coordinate and y-coordinate) and moves the motors to position the tip at the given co-ordinate.
- Test the Angle_config
<due by 19th of November>


November 2nd

- Read/ understand StepperMotorDemoCode
- Write function to move motor 1 by one step
- Write function to move motor 2 by one step
- Write function that takes an angle as an input and moves the motor(s) by that angle
- Team Project Proposal
