AIMLAB Writing Tool Project
 Team members are: Eddie Seung Hun Ha (esh376), Mariam ElSahhar (me1693), Ahmad Salous (as12106)

The device we're designing aims to help people with any physical impairments write.
The device utilizes two stepper motors moving two arms that are connected together at a point that has an electromagnet.
The basic concept is: the user would hold a pen with a magnet at its tip, the motors would be programmed to move the electromagnet
in the shape of a certain letter to guide the user's hand along a specified path indicated on the screen, the electromagnet would be
programmed such that, should the user stray away from the path indicated on the screen the strength of the magnet would 
increase pulling the user's hand back. 

The device would utilize: 2 stepper motors, an electromagnet, an Arduino mini board (and later on a Raspberry Pi)
